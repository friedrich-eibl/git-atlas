## What is GitAtlas?

GitAtlas turns a GitHub repository into a **visual, drill-down map**.

Instead of scrolling endless file trees, you get an overview that lets you:

- See how a project is structured at a glance
- Identify large or important areas of the codebase
- Drill down into folders interactively
- Share or embed diagrams in documentation and READMEs

It works **without authentication** for public repositories.
